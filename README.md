**Address Hero** was created to help people store contacts and addresses. Furthermore, it was designed to keep track of cards you have sent in the mail by logging the event each time a card is sent. Users log in and add contacts to their Address Book. Within each contact's profile, there is an option to add addresses. Once addresses are added, users have an option to log the event of sending a card in the mail. After an event is logged, it will be added to a user's timeline. Users can utilize their timeline to keep track of all cards they have sent historically. Keeping track of addresses and remembering which cards you've sent to whom just got a whole lot easier!
